## ways to contribute

### Ideas
The [discussions page](https://github.com/SilenLoc/vanity/discussions) can be used for new ideas in general.

If you have ideas related to the code or the repository, you may consider creating an issue.
___
### Code

You may contribute by creating PRs directly, forks are not considered best practice for now.

Some rules:
- Whenever possible write tests (almost always possible).
- UI code needs to be as simple as possible, no logic, no direct interface use.
- DRY is not the first rule of programming..., consider duplicating over coupling.
