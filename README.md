## ways to contribute

### Ideas
The [discussions page](https://github.com/SilenLoc/easyreading/discussions) can be used to give new ideas, maybe new ways to help NDs read better.

If you have ideas related to the code or repository, you may consider creating an issue.
___
### Code

You may contribute by creating PRs directly, forks are not considered best practice for now.

Some rules:
- Whenever possible write tests (almost always possible).
- UI code needs to be as simple as possible, no logic, no direct interface use.
- DRY is not the first rule of programming..., consider duplicating over coupling.
